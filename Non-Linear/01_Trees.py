Binary Tree:

tree can have 2 node each from root = binary tree

tree with more than 2 node out of single node is non binary tree

### Full tree = tree leaf points to 0 or 2 nodes

####perfect tree = all leaf node at same level 

#### complete = filling tree left to right and if leaf node only has 1 node then tree is complete but not full and not
at all perfect

but if we fill left to right on leaf nodes and most of the leaf nodes have 2 nodes to it then its a complete and full


if all leaf nodes are 2 then its a perfect tree 

parent = root node

child of root = child

child at same level =siblings

child can only have 1 parent always in a tree
and a child of root can have child roots as well so they can be parent of other child nodes

the nodes with no child =leaf nodes


i,e root with 2 leaf only

or 
2 mid nodes after root with 2 leaf node each all with same node
total 7
